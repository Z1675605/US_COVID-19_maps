### GEOG 458 Lab 4 Map

In this lab I create two thematic maps which map COVID-19 within the United States. My first map is a choropleth map that gathers the rate of infection per thousand by county, my second map is a dot density map which gathers the numbers of cases per each county. Each map has an interacive feature that engages the user to spend more time learning about COVID statistics.

## Map 1: [United States COVID-19 Rates per County](https://z1675605.github.io/US_COVID-19_maps/map1.html)

In this map I created a hover based interation where the user can hover over each county and learn the rate of cases per thousand. The data used is from the [US CENSUS](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US%24050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true).

## Map 2: [United States COVID-19 Cases Tracker](https://z1675605.github.io/US_COVID-19_maps/map2.html)

In this map I created a click based interaction where the user can click on each dot to learn more about the cases and deaths per county. The data used is from the [NY TIMES](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv) github page.
