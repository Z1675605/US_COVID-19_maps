### GEOG 458 Lab 4 Map

In this lab I create two thematic maps which map COVID-19 within the United States. My first map is a choropleth map that gathers the rate of infection per thousand by county, my second map is a dot density map which gathers the numbers of cases per each county. Each map has an interacive feature that engages the user to spend more time learning about COVID statistics.

## Map 1: [United States COVID-19 Rates per County](https://z1675605.github.io/US_COVID-19_maps/map1.html)
